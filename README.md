In this project, I created a python code to retrieve a list of stopped Ec2 intances in the "us-east-1" region on AWS, generate a csv file containing that list and upload it to a prexisting S3 bucket. I also created an alarm and an SNS topic which allowed me to to track the update "number of objects" in the bucket. This code also create a log file for further debugging. Finally, I sent an email to a user and a specific message to the user given phone number.
